# **House Price Prediction Model**

This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model based on various house features. The dataset includes different characteristics of houses and their corresponding prices.

## **Problem Statement**
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the prices of different types of houses based on the provided dataset, which contains 79 explanatory variables. The project dataset is based on housing data from Ames, Iowa, and the model will predict house prices using these variables.

## **Dataset Overview**
The dataset contains:

- 1460 observations
- 38 numeric variables
- 43 categorical variables

## **Objective**
The objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices with minimal error using the dataset. The challenge lies in dealing with different types of variables, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and selecting the best algorithm for regression tasks.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- XGBoost / Random Forest / Gradient Boosting (for model development)

## **Evaluation Metrics**
The model's performance will be evaluated based on how accurately it predicts the house prices in the test dataset, compared to the actual prices.
